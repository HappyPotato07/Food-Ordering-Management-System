The Online Food Order Management System (OFOMS) is a Python-based project developed to enhance the operational efficiency of Spiderman Online Food Services. This system is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for both administrators and customers, offering a seamless experience for managing food orders. With robust functionality, the platform ensures that customers can easily browse the menu, place orders, and make payments, while administrators can manage menu items and analyze customer data efficiently.

The system features distinct functionalities for administrators, customers, and guests. Administrators have access to a secure login system that enables them to add, modify, and remove food items, as well as display and search through customer records. Customers, after registering and logging in, can view the menu, explore food categories, place orders, and manage their carts with ease. Guests can browse the menu without registration and are encouraged to sign up for additional features.
